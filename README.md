Implementation:

We intend on having a general js function that will be called on a game start button. This will then start the game with the player at the top falling down to randomly generated obstacles that will rise to the top of the screen. Weâ€™ll have a class (function) of platforms and one of obstacles and will differentiate their behaviors. The player tries to avoid getting hit by the top, with score increasing as time goes on.
